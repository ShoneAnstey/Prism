## Overview
Prism Reader is a browser extension that helps you read RSS, Atom, and XML feeds. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection
Prism Reader does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

## What is stored locally

- Reading statistics (article count, streak, history)
- User preferences (theme, view mode)
- OPML backups of your subscriptions
- Read Later queue
- Keyword watchlist

## Network requests
Prism Reader makes network requests **only** to:
- Fetch RSS/Atom/XML feed content from URLs **you** subscribe to or visit
- These requests go directly to the feed source — no intermediary servers are involved

## Third-party services
Prism Reader does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

## Data sharing
Your data is **never** shared with third parties. Period.
