# Privacy Policy for Prism RSS Reader

**Last Updated:** February 11, 2026

Prism RSS Reader ("Prism") is an open-source browser extension designed to respect your privacy. This policy describes how Prism handles your data.

## 1. No Data Collection
Prism does not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal information, browsing history, or feed data to us or any third parties.

## 2. Local Storage
All data, including your subscribed feeds, "Read Later" bookmarks, and preferences, are stored locally on your device using the browser's `chrome.storage.local` API. This data never leaves your browser.

## 3. External Requests
Prism only makes network requests to:
-   **Fetch Feeds:** When you open the extension or background refresh triggers, Prism connects directly to the URLs of the RSS/Atom feeds you have explicitly subscribed to in order to download the latest content.
-   **Favicons:** Prism may fetch favicons for your feeds using Google's Favicon service (`https://www.google.com/s2/favicons`) to display icons next to feed titles.

## 4. Analytics and Tracking
Prism contains no analytics, tracking scripts, or telemetry. We do not know who uses the extension or what feeds they subscribe to.

## 5. Contact
